Portfolio
=====================
*Site under construction - August 2017*
*I am currently in progress with the code and Sass for this project*

This is a personal portfolio site I have built from scratch.

My intention was to dive deep with learning and engraining the fundamentals of proper, industry-standard HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript code (including responsive, mobile-first design patterns).
