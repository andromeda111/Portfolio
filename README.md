Portfolio
=====================

This is a personal portfolio site I have built from scratch.

My intention was to dive deep with learning and engraining the fundamentals of proper, industry-standard HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript code (including responsive, mobile-first design patterns).

I also used Gulp as a task-runner for compiling Sass and optimizing code.
